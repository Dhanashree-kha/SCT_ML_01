# SCT_ML_01
🏷 SCT_MLTASK1 – Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

📌 Task Objective
To segment customers into distinct groups based on behavioral and demographic features using unsupervised learning techniques (K-Means Clustering), enabling better targeting and business strategies.

🧠 What I Did

Loaded and explored the customer dataset

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends

Preprocessed the data (scaling, encoding, and handling missing values)

Applied the K-Means clustering algorithm

Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method

Visualized the resulting customer segments

🛠 Tools Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

📊 Output

Formed distinct customer clusters based on shared features

Visualized clusters using 2D plots

Helped identify potential target segments for marketing and personalization

📚 What I Learned

Fundamentals of unsupervised learning and clustering

How to preprocess and scale data for clustering

Evaluation and interpretation of cluster results

Importance of EDA in customer analytics
